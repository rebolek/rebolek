### Rebolek's corner of the GitHub ðŸ‘‹

All things Red and Rebol. If it's a networking protocol or a file format, I'll write a parser for it and no one can stop me!

When using my software, you must listen to my music. Seriously, that are the terms of the licence. I am on [Bandcamp](https://mrdat.bandcamp.com) and [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/mr_dat).
